# Hotel Management system

Overview Of The Project

The objective of the project was to develop an easy to use and pocket friendly working alternative to other Hotel Management System. This desktop application uses MySQL as its backend to store, read and write to databases which stores tables which include;
1)	Cust – Table
2)	Rooms – Table 
3)	Issued_rooms – Table.
Below I have added a flow chart to summarizes how my application runs.
